      Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 - October 5, 2011) was an American
      entrepreneur, industrial designer, business magnate, media proprietor, and
      investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the chairman
      and majority shareholder of Pixar, a member of The Walt Disney Company's
      board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder,
      chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He is widely recognized as a pioneer of the
      personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early
      business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

      Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American
      mother. He was adopted shortly after his birth. Jobs attended Reed College
      in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through
      India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and
      Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal
      computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with
      production and sale of the Apple II, oue of the first highly successful
      mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the
      Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user
      interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple
      Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984,the first
      mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop
      publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple Laser Writer,
      the first laser printer to feature vector graphics.
